## Git & GitHub

### Definitions

**_The Head_** - Represents the most recent commit. There is an ID assigned to each commit, which allows you to always revert back to it.

**_Branch_** - Removes your work and commits from the master/main branch. Created by running `git branch && git checkout <branch_name>`. Once work is completed in the branch you move back to the master/main branch by running `git checkout && git merge <branch_name>`. This makes the tip of your branch the head of the master/main branch.
